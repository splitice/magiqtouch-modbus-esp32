## Tested and working with:
- Evaporative Cooler (Breezair EZQ155)
- Gas Heater (Braemar TQ430N)
- 2 Zones
- 2 Wall Controllers running software revision R719.
 

## Known Limitations
- Refrigerated Cooling not tested or supported.
- Zones 3 & 4 not implemented. (Values are likely next in order from existing zone data)
- Zone 1 temp sensor does not report correctly on non-temperature target modes.
  (Temp reporting issue seems to occur in official module too, incorrectly reports temperature on app when using Fan mode).
- Has only been tested with controller version R719.
- WiFi controller status does not reflect ESP WiFi state.
- This project does not support the RF 'Wireless' Magiqtouch Controller as they do not support the official WiFi module.
